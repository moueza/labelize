# Labelize

-Often you set basic numbered labels in comments. But with accumulation, and back revisions, you INSERT new numbered labels between 2 numbered labels. And if they were 2 consecutive integers, you come to insert floats, by dot introduction, longer and longer, but it is too awful! 

So you want to move them back to integers for instance #6 , respectul of your float hierarchy order. Labelize is there to manage these numbered labels. 

-Ultimately, numbers could be as increasing as possible from top to bottom of the text, 

-and multi files sensitive #3 . 

-Even, file clustered #4 : if wanted, least sensitive figures can be linked to files. E.g. if 15 files present, in a.txt lbl123->lbl01 123. 

-Even function patterns #5 : if 15 methods in a file 01 123 to 15 123.

-iso scattered #7 : lbl1 lbl2 lbl9 -> 1 5 9 (lbl1 lbl5 lbl9)

-percent normalized in 0-100 #8 : lbl5 lbl203 -> max=203 -> /(203/100) -> lbl5/2.03 lbl100
